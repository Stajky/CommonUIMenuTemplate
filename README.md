# CommonUIMenuTemplate
This project is a research project that explores the experimental CommonUI plugin from Unreal Engine. It should work as an example/template for future implementations. 

Road map:
- [x] Main menu
- [x] Credits
- [x] Loading screen
- [x] Save and load system
- [x] Load and save UI
- [x] Player HUD
- [x] Mock/Cheat GAS-like communication for Widget Controllers
- [x] Pause menu
- [x] Settings
- [ ] Beautifly (well at least make passable :D)
- [ ] Write summary about CommonUI


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses Seamless Travel so for full experience start it in Standalone. If you play in PIE it will work the same only you will not see the loading screens.
