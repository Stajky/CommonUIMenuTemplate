# CommonUIMenuTemplate
This project is a research project that explores the experimental CommonUI plugin from Unreal Engine. It should work as an example/template for future implementations. 

Road map:
- [x] Main menu

- [ ] Player HUD
- [ ] Mock GAS-like communication for player HUD
- [ ] Pause menu
